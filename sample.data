          "I've replaced my 8 year old hp printer which was costing me a lot of money when it comes to ink and cartridges with this one. It's working just how I expected, I'm using it since 2 weeks now. The tank takes up all the 70ml colour inks at once which were sent apart from the black one (170ml) which is half consumed. I also got an additional bottle of black ink with it.",
